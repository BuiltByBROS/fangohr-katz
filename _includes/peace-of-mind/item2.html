                        <p class="font-content p-content-about">Over the last 15 years we have transformed residential lofts, historic hotel lobbies, SoHo showrooms and more, always working to make our clients happy. </p>
                        <p class="font-content p-content-about">But it’s not just about transformation — Katz Architecture also works as a partner to building managers, design professionals, and city agencies to ensure the ongoing integrity of our built environment.</p>
